# ML Project: Forecasting Export Value of Crop Products

## Overview
This project aims to build a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to forecast the export value of crop products for a geographical region three years into the future. Given historical data, the model predicts the export value three years ahead. The model can be either a regression or a classification model, depending on the approach taken.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical data on crop products, including various features such as area, year, land use, total production, export quantity, and exchange rate. The dataset is available in the data folder.

## Project Environment.
This project was developed using azure-ai-ml SDK and Azure Machine Learning Workspace.
